###To start a service with another service ###

We do this by two stages

- First, we need to add BindsTo to our unit file which we want to start or die by which service. If buildbot_master.service starts , our service starts.

```bash
BindsTo=buildbot_master.service
```
-Second, if buildbot_master.service dies , our service doesn't die, so wee need to add to buildbot_master.service below lines. 

```bash

Wants=ncat_buildbot_master.service
Before=ncat_buildbot_master.service
```
